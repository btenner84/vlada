# VladaHealth Platform Overview

## Introduction
VladaHealth is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the analysis and processing of medical bills. It leverages advanced technologies, including AI and database integrations, to provide accurate service matching and categorization.

## Dashboard Features
- **User Interface:** The dashboard serves as the central hub for users, offering functionalities such as bill uploads, analysis initiation, and result viewing.
- **User Personalization:** Features like `UserAvatar`, `ProcessStep`, and `ProfileSection` enhance user engagement and process visualization.

## Bill Analysis Process
1. **Document Upload:** Users can upload medical bills in various formats (PDF, image).
2. **Text Extraction:** Utilizes OCR for images and text extraction libraries for PDFs to extract service descriptions.
3. **AI-Enhanced Analysis:** Determines if a document is a medical bill and extracts relevant data using enhanced AI analysis.

1. **Exact Code Lookup:** Validates and looks up extracted codes in the database.
2. **Exact Description Match:** Normalizes and searches for exact matches in the database.
3. **Keyword Matching:** Extracts keywords for enhanced matching.
4. **AI-Driven Semantic Matching:** Uses OpenAI for potential matches if no high-confidence match is found.
